## Education
**Slovak university of technology in Bratislava, Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies (FIIT STU)**

2018 - 2023

I got my bachelor's and master's degree here. Master's thesis focused on Data lake development with the use of GenAI

## Work experience
### PwC - Java backend developer

*(02/2023 - present)*

My current job, working on microservices created in Java and Spring Boot. I work on a big project for US client, which is surprisingly using a lot of modern technologies - we are using **Java 17** with **Spring Boot 3**, kubernetes infrastructure on **Azure** and **Azure pipelines** automating pretty much the whole software lifecycle. Other than Java I also did some one-time scripting jobs in bash or Python - stuff like migrating data from one database to another, transforming some data etc.

This job allowed me to focus much more on the backend side of things. I get more hands-on experience with enterprise software development.

### IBM Slovakia - DevOps engineer

*(02/2020 - 01/2023)*

My first actual job in software engineering. I started here as an intern during my second year of college studies and stayed as a part-time employee after initial 6 months. I was part of the DevOps team, where we at first managed old-school **linux and windows server VMs**, but then slowly transitioned our infrastructure to containers and **kubernetes**. I was also supporting our Dev and QA team by creating internal tools. These tools were mainly in **Python** or **Java** and did things like easy content delivery, cleanup automation etc.

The biggest benefit of this job was seeing every aspect of the **software engineering lifecycle**. It allowed me to create complex tools from scratch, witness and help with transition from VMs to cloud and also practice **german language** as the project I was part of had a german client.

### Yves Rocher - Tech support

*(05/2019 - 01/2020)*

I got this job right after my first year at the university. It was a good experience, my main responsibilities was basic tech support for Yves Rocher stores across Slovakia. This included the usual "have you tried turning it off and on again?", PC installations but also a bit of networking stuff.

I would say that the biggest benefit of this position was that it taught me how to **communicate better** with people that are not that tech-savy. My **soft skills** in general were improved a lot during my time in Yves Rocher, as I was talking to different kinds of people, basically every day.
