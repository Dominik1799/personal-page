In PWC I am currently working on various Java Spring Boot micro-services. They are part of a larger project that is the main focus of tens of developers, QA teams, product owners, scrum masters etc. The main focus of this project is to provide a platform for clients to work with data - share it, analyze it, create reports from it etc. So the emphasis is on speed, safety and good user experience. 

My job is the development of various microservices - we maintain existing ones but my team also developed some from scratch. For development, we use the "documentation first" approach - we create OpenAPI spec for every microservice first and only after that, we generate necessary server stubs which we can use to develop the microservice further. 

Other than pure Java coding, I developed a few Python solutions as well - mostly data manipulation tasks.
